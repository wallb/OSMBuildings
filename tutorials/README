### Adding a tutorial

To add a tutorial to the docs, create a new file in the tutorials directory, with the `md` extension, and add the following code to it, filling in the `TODO:` sections:

````
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OSMBuildings/OSMBuildings/master/dist/OSMBuildings/OSMBuildings.css">
<link rel=stylesheet href=assets/tutorial_prep.css>
<script src=https://rawgit.com/OSMBuildings/OSMBuildings/master/dist/OSMBuildings/OSMBuildings.js></script>

<div id='map'></div>

<script src=assets/tutorial_prep.js></script>

<script>
  // TODO: Working example code goes below here
  // map and osmb are accessible. It is recommended to set the position, zoom, etc
</script>

### TODO: Place tutorial text here, formatted in markdown
